##  Description

This project demonstrates how to create a scalable and reusable infrastructure setup on AWS by building a custom AMI (Amazon Machine Image) from an EC2 instance and using it in a Launch Template. Jenkins, a powerful automation server for CI/CD, is installed and configured on the instance to create a pre-baked infrastructure that reduces repetitive setup and accelerates development workflows.

---

##  Why This Project?

In the real world, DevOps engineers often need to create **repeatable infrastructure** that can be quickly replicated and launched. Instead of setting up Jenkins on every new EC2 manually, this project helps you:

- Automate Jenkins installation.
- Save time using pre-configured AMIs.
- Build scalable launch templates.
- Improve consistency across environments.

| **AMI**            | Store a configured image of an EC2 instance                             |
| **Launch Template**| Define a template to launch multiple instances easily                   |
| **Security Groups**| Control access (e.g., SSH 22, Jenkins 8080)                             |

##  Project Workflow

###  Step 1: Create Base EC2 Instance (`ec2-1`)

- Launch an EC2 instance with:
  - **ubuntu**
  - **Instance Type:** t2.micro (Free Tier)
  - **Key Pair:** `my-key.pem`
  - **Security Group:**
    - SSH â€“ Port 22 (Your IP)
    - HTTP â€“ Port 8080 (for Jenkins, Your IP)

### ðŸ”— Step 2: Connect to EC2

#### Option 1: Using EC2 Instance Connect  
Use the AWS Console to connect directly.

#### Option 2: if you Using Git Bash  
bash
ssh -i "my-key.pem" ec2-user@<public-ip-address>


---


## Step 3: Install Jenkins on EC2
Run these commands inside your EC2 terminal:
## 1. Update system packages
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y

### 2. Install Java (required for Jenkins)
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

### 3. Add Jenkins repository key
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

### 4. Add Jenkins repository
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

### 5. Update package list
sudo apt update -y

### 6. Install Jenkins
sudo apt install jenkins -y

### 7. Start Jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins

###8. Enable Jenkins to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable jenkins

##Step 4: Access Jenkins Web UI
Open your browser:
http://<public-ip>:8080
To get the admin password:
bash command:
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

---

## Step 5: Create a Custom AMI
Once Jenkins is successfully installed and running on your EC2 instance, follow these steps to create a reusable custom AMI:

Go to the EC2 Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.

Select your running EC2 instance (e.g., ec2-jenkins-instance).

Click on Actions â†’ Image and templates â†’ Create image.

Provide a name and an optional description for your AMI.

Click Create Image.

 This creates a pre-configured AMI with Jenkins already installed and set up. You can now launch multiple instances using this AMI without repeating the Jenkins installation steps.

---
## Step 6: Launch EC2 Instance from AMI (demo-2)
After the AMI is available (Status: available in AMIs section):

Go to EC2 Dashboard â†’ AMIs.

Select the custom AMI you just created.

Click Launch instance from image.

Configure instance settings:

Name: demo-2

Instance type: t2.micro (or as required)

Key pair, Security group, etc.

Click Launch instance.

âœ… This will launch a new EC2 instance (demo-2) with Jenkins pre-installed and ready to use.


---


## Step 7: Create a Launch Template
Now, create a launch template based on the AMI:

Go to the Launch Templates section in the EC2 Dashboard.

Click Create launch template.

Fill in the required fields:

Launch template name

AMI ID (select the one you created earlier)

Instance type

Key pair, Security Group, and other settings

Click Create launch template.

 This allows you to launch multiple Jenkins-ready EC2 instances automatically and consistently
