##  Description

This project demonstrates how to create a scalable and reusable infrastructure setup on AWS by building a custom AMI (Amazon Machine Image) from an EC2 instance and using it in a Launch Template. Jenkins, a powerful automation server for CI/CD, is installed and configured on the instance to create a pre-baked infrastructure that reduces repetitive setup and accelerates development workflows.

##  Why This Project?

In the real world, DevOps engineers often need to create **repeatable infrastructure** that can be quickly replicated and launched. Instead of setting up Jenkins on every new EC2 manually, this project helps you:

- Automate Jenkins installation.
- Save time using pre-configured AMIs.
- Build scalable launch templates.
- Improve consistency across environments.

This project is perfect for:
- Final-year students
- AWS beginners
- Job seekers building DevOps portfolios

##  Project Workflow

###  Step 1: Create Base EC2 Instance (`ec2-1`)

- Launch an EC2 instance with:
  - **Amazon Linux 2**
  - **Instance Type:** t2.micro (Free Tier)
  - **Key Pair:** `my-key.pem`
  - **Security Group:**
    - SSH â€“ Port 22 (Your IP)
    - HTTP â€“ Port 8080 (for Jenkins, Your IP)

### ðŸ”— Step 2: Connect to EC2

#### Option 1: Using EC2 Instance Connect  
Use the AWS Console to connect directly.

#### Option 2: Using Git Bash  
```bash
ssh -i "my-key.pem" ec2-user@<public-ip-address>
